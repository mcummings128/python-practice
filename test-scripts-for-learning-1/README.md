Here's some random notes about Python too:

When you install Python, you're installing the Python interpreter. (You're also adding the interpreter to PATH during setup)
The interpreter takes the human-readable Python language and translates into binary, so the computer can understand it

Python comes with a standard library of built-in modules and packages.
A module is a single Python .py file, containing things like functions and classes
A package is a directory that contains multiple modules and potenitially sub-packages. Packages are identified by containing an `__init.py__` file

You can import these modules and packages for use via the import keyword. You may have to use pip, the XXXX package installer to install certain modules and packages that are not built-in by default. If you try to import a module/package that isn't installed, TODO
